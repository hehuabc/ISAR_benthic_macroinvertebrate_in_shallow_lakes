These are the codes of our study "Climate-associated variation in the drivers of benthic macroinvertebrate spe-cies-area relationships across shallow freshwater lakes". We have submitted this paper to Journal of Animal Ecology. We will also achieve them in Dryad Digital Repository upon final acceptance.

We have four code files. 
First, the codes showed how we calculated rarefied species richness using iNEXT. 
Second, the codes showed that how we analyis ISRAs and figures 2-3 were also shown here.
Third, the codes showed how we plot the world map and locations of our studied lakes.
Fourth, the codes showed how we plot the figures of supplementary materials

The other.RDS files achieved relevant data. 
The raw species and environmental data were not shown here as they are generating another paper. 
Anyone who want to get those raw data, please contact hehu@niglas.ac.cn.
